# TODOs

## Prio cases

* class components
  * basic âœ…
  * mixins ?!
* Vuetify
* axios ?
* build changes
* webpack -> vite

## Backend changes needed

* Runtime config (BACKEND) (frontend done)
  * Instead of creating a json file, it would be perfect to have a env file
  * Nuxt will automatically replace config with env content during runtime
  * <https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/runtime-config>

## Later

* jest ? or vitest ?
* pwa
* nuxt extends : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvTui3P0w-o>
* translation / i18n
  * Wait for transitions
  * lazy load translations
  * translations per SFC (Component)
  * resx ? (maybe a migration tool when migrating over?)
  * translation process (something else than copy pasting json files?)

## Examples

Create further examples which might be useful

* vue use example ? (composable)

## Migration process

If we really want to migrate a project, collect how we are going to do things:

* mixins?

## Other external topics / migration / improvements

* mixins -> how to solve message mixin within nuxt -> plugin?

## Developer Experience / VSCode

Possible future improvements

* Create dev-container with docker to have a base setup running ?
